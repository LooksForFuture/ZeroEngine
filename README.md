# ZeroEngine
Zero is a game engine/framework written for c++ with simplicity and functionality in mind.<br />
Zero has been designed to be both user friendly and configurable. The only hard requirements are C++ 17, SDL2 and SDL2-image.<br /><br />
Special thanks to @royvandam for his <a href="https://github.com/royvandam/rtti">rtti</a> library.<br />
LazyFoo's <a href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/">tutorial series</a> is a really good resource for learning SDL. I didn't need to add SDL's DLL files to path as he said. Instead, I put them in the source and release directory of my project.

## Attention!!!
I should complete the readme. I'm really really, really... busy. Busier than what you think.<br />
There are so many projects that I'm working on at the same time, so it makes me some time to write a good readme.<br />
But, the most important thing that I can tell is that I had a massive progress in developing my own game engine.<br />
I learned so many things and this repo can be a very good learning resource for anyone interested.
